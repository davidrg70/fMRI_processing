Script_proc_1stL_wl_job
Processes fMRI data for the Ebner et al (2011) task, which is a phonological task, self-paced. Later it runs a 1st-Level analysis (2-way T-test to compare the two parts of the task: Phonological >/< Fractals). It includes a mask and scrubbing using CerebroMatic (Wilke et al. 2017 - https://doi.org/10.3389/fncom.2017.00005).

Script_proc_1stL_wm_job
Processes fMRI data for the Siffredi et al (2011) task, which is a phonological task, self-paced. Later it runs a 1st-Level analysis (2-way T-test to compare the two parts of the task: Encoding >/< Retrieval).  It includes a mask and scrubbing using CerebroMatic (Wilke et al. 2017 - https://doi.org/10.3389/fncom.2017.00005).
